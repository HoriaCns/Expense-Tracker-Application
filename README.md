Finora - Expense Tracker

Finora is a modern, cross-platform expense tracking application built with Flutter and backed by Appwrite. It allows users to securely track their daily expenses, view spending habits over time, and manage their finances effectively.

üì≤ How to Install the App on Your Android Device

Follow these steps to install Finora on your Android phone.


Step 1: Transfer the File to Your Phone

First, get the app-release.apk file onto your device. You can download it from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VY-g-CJ1RiGrIH0Uyp9wure-WYsuB9iP/view?usp=drive_link

Download the file to your phone's "Downloads" folder.


Step 2: Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"

For security, Android phones block installations from outside the Google Play Store by default. You need to grant permission to install this test version.

    Open your phone's Settings.

    Go to Security or Apps & notifications > Special app access.

    Look for an option named Install unknown apps.

    Find the app you used to download the file (e.g., your browser like Chrome, or your file manager like Files by Google).

    Tap on it and toggle on the switch for Allow from this source.

Step 3: Install the App

    Open your phone's File Manager app and navigate to your "Downloads" folder.

    Find and tap on the app-release.apk file.

    A prompt will appear asking if you want to install the application. Tap Install.

    Once the installation is complete, you can open Finora from your app drawer just like any other app!

Enjoy testing!
